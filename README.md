# Cortex

Production-grade AI research and RAG orchestration platform built with LangGraph, FastAPI, Inngest, and Supabase.

![Kapture 2026-03-05 at 14 08 29](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08d4fcf9-855f-410c-8520-76a376f774fd)

## What it does

Cortex runs multi-step web research workflows, streams progress in real time, generates structured reports, and supports grounded follow-up chat over retrieved sources. It also includes a reliable asynchronous ingestion pipeline for user-uploaded RAG resources.

## Signature capabilities

- Stateful LangGraph orchestration with explicit routing for success, empty, and failure paths.
- Streaming research execution over SSE for responsive UX during long-running workflows.
- Session-scoped research history and follow-up chat grounded to per-run source chunks.
- Durable ingestion pipeline with transactional outbox, dispatcher, and idempotent workers.
- End-to-end observability with trace spans across graph nodes and external dependencies.

## Stack and tools

- Orchestration: `LangGraph`
- API and streaming: `FastAPI`, `Uvicorn`, Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- LLM and agent layer: `LangChain`, `OpenAI`, `Ollama`
- Web research and parsing: `Tavily`, `httpx`, `BeautifulSoup`
- Retrieval and reranking: `Pinecone`
- Async jobs and event delivery: `Inngest`, transactional outbox dispatcher
- Auth, sessions, and storage: `Supabase` (Postgres, Auth, Storage)
- Frontend: `React 19`, `Vite`, `TypeScript`, `react-markdown`
- Observability: `LangSmith`
- Quality tooling: `pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `ESLint`

## Architecture

### Research execution flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    userQuery["User query"] --> apiResearch["POST /research or /sessions/{id}/research"]
    apiResearch --> search["search (Tavily)"]
    search -->|"continue"| retrieve["retrieve (httpx + BeautifulSoup)"]
    search -->|"abort"| abortNode["abort"]
    retrieve -->|"ok"| memoryContext["memory_context (Pinecone search)"]
    retrieve -->|"empty"| emptyNode["empty"]
    memoryContext --> rerank["rerank"]
    rerank --> summarize["summarize (LLM)"]
    summarize --> report["report generation"]
    report --> stream["SSE stream to UI"]
    stream --> endNode["END"]
    abortNode --> endNode
    emptyNode --> endNode
```

### Reliable ingestion flow (outbox pattern)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    upload["Upload resource"] --> apiUpload["POST /api/rag/resources/upload"]
    apiUpload --> tx["Atomic DB RPC\nresource + job + outbox"]
    tx --> resources["rag_resources"]
    tx --> jobs["rag_ingestion_jobs (queued)"]
    tx --> outbox["event_outbox (pending)"]

    dispatcher["Outbox dispatcher"] --> claim["Claim outbox row\npending -> dispatching"]
    claim --> publish["Publish event to Inngest"]
    publish --> worker["Inngest worker\nrag/ingestion.requested"]
    worker --> jobClaim["Claim job\nqueued -> running"]
    jobClaim --> ingest["Ingest from Supabase signed URL"]
    ingest --> artifacts["rag_sidecar_artifacts"]
    ingest --> complete["job -> succeeded\nresource -> ready"]

    claim -->|"send error"| retry["Backoff and retry"]
    jobClaim -->|"already claimed or terminal"| noop["No-op (idempotent)"]
```

## Run locally

1) Install dependencies and configure environment:

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
```

2) Start backend API:

```bash
uv run python -m src.main serve --reload
```

3) Start frontend UI:

```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

4) Start event + ingestion workers:

```bash
# Terminal A: Inngest dev server
npx --ignore-scripts=false inngest-cli@latest dev -u http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/inngest --no-discovery

# Terminal B: Outbox dispatcher loop
while true; do uv run python -m src.main rag-dispatch-outbox --limit 100; sleep 2; done
```

## API surface

Key endpoints:

- `GET /health` - liveness check.
- `POST /research` - sessionless research run with SSE streaming.
- `POST /sessions` - create authenticated session.
- `GET /sessions` - list authenticated user sessions.
- `POST /sessions/{id}/research` - run research in-session with SSE streaming.
- `POST /sessions/{id}/followup` - grounded follow-up chat over run sources.

Example research request:

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8000/research \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is LangGraph?", "use_vector_store": false}'
```

## Best practices implemented

- Transactional outbox for exactly-once intent before external dispatch.
- Idempotent job claiming to prevent duplicate ingestion under retries.
- Concurrent-safe state transitions for outbox dispatch and ingestion jobs.
- Auth-scoped session boundaries for data isolation across users.
- Stream-first API design for long-running AI workflows.
- Structured observability across orchestration nodes and dependency calls.

## Development checks

```bash
uv run pytest -v
uv run ruff check src
uv run mypy src
```
